    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The department of Mathematics was established in 1956 and over the
                years has evolved into a Department with a healthy balance between
                pure and applied mathematics. The Department has a vibrant research
                atmosphere backed up by excellent infrastructural facilities.
                We have a modern computer laboratory and a good Departmental library.
                <a href="faculty.html">Members of our faculty</a> have won many
                honours in recognition of their academic achievements. </p>

              <p>The Department admits students under two programmes - the <a href="degprog-phd.html">Ph.D.
                programme</a> and the <a href="degprog-intphd.html">integrated
                Ph.D. programme</a>. Further information can be found by following
                the links on the home page. In the current economic scenario,
                employment opportunities for Ph.D.'s in mathematics are excellent
                - both in academics and in industry. </p>

              <p>The Department has pioneered interdisciplinary programmes like
                the <a href="http://math.iisc.ernet.in/~imi" target="_blank">IISc
                Mathematics Initiative</a>. It takes active part in the Indo-French <a href="http://disc.iisc.ernet.in/ficus/ficus.html" target="_blank">Cyber
                University project</a> with Toulouse University Network. The Department
                is also deeply involved in the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana
                and the Mathematical
                Olympiad programme.</p>
